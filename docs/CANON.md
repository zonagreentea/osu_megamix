# Canon (So Far)

This project has canon.

Canon here does not mean story, characters, or plot.
It means **what is allowed to be true without breaking the system**.

Not everything canon must be explainable.
Only everything canon must be consistent.

## Core Canon

- Time is authoritative.
- Audio defines the timeline.
- Gameplay rules are projections layered onto time.
- Failure never stops the mix; it only reroutes the player.
- Nothing depends on hardware.
- Nothing depends on secrecy.
- If it is not written, it does not exist.

## Imagination (Canon Definition)

Imagination is not fantasy.
Imagination is not randomness.
Imagination is not lore.

Imagination is the act of moving through the system
without stopping the mix.

Imagination exists between valid states.
It does not create outcomes.
It chooses paths that already exist.

Imagination is canon because it preserves motion.

## Mascots (Canon Function)

Mascots are not characters.
Mascots are not avatars.
Mascots are not narrators.

Mascots are **permission signals**.

They indicate how it is safe to act emotionally
inside a system governed by strict rules.

They never override mechanics.
They never determine success.
They exist to prevent hesitation from becoming collapse.

---

## Continuity

- The mix always continues.
- Players never truly end.
- Observation must never become control.
- Fun is allowed to outweigh strict logic.
- Repairs come after play, never during it.

---

## Themes

Music anchors canon emotionally, not narratively.
Themes are not references; they are **orientation points**.

Imagination’s canon theme:
- **私以外私じゃないの – Remix** — Gesu No Kiwami Otome, PARKGOLF

The theme exists so Imagination does not need a mascot.

## Status

This canon is incomplete by design.
It will expand only when expansion does not break invariants.
Nothing here will be retconned—only clarified.

The system is alive.
The mix is intact.
Motion is preserved.
