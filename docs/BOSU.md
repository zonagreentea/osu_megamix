# BOSU — Bust-to-osu

BOSU is the per-player reroute state: **Bust-to-osu**.

Invariant:
- Audio/timeline (t) remains the Megamix program.
- Player projection switches to osu rules.
- No ending, no elimination, no pause — just reroute.

Trigger:
- Player fail (in megamix rules) OR player-initiated safety reroute.

Non-goals:
- BOSU is not a separate song, not a mode select, not a restart.
