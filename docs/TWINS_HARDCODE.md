# TWINS (HARDCODE)

This document hardcodes the **Twins** concept into writing.
If it isn’t written here, it does not exist.

## Definition
Twins are paired constructs that:
- Share constraints
- Do not share authority
- Cannot override each other
- Remain legible when separated

They exist to prevent drift, not to create power.

## The Twins

### 1) ARTIFACT ↔ FILE
- Artifact: name, vibe, nickname, oral history
- File: written anchor, versioned, reviewable
Rule: Artifacts may inspire files. Files never rewrite artifacts.

### 2) JSON ↔ VB.NET
- JSON: truth, contracts, canon
- VB.NET: rendering, routing, ergonomics
Rule: VB.NET may not invent facts not present in JSON.

### 3) MIX ↔ MODE
- Mix: timeline + audio authority
- Mode: rules projected onto the mix
Rule: Modes consolidate onto the mix. The mix is never fractured.

### 4) FREEZE ↔ RUN
- Freeze: no mutation, no reinterpretation
- Run: execution is allowed
Rule: Running is permitted while frozen. Editing is not.

### 5) BALL ↔ CANON
- Ball: soft, bounded, exploratory (exactly four)
- Canon: declared, stable, written
Rule: Ball may suggest. Canon decides.

## Hard Constraints
- No hidden twins.
- No third twin added implicitly.
- Any change requires an explicit written update to this file.

## Status
HARDCODED.
