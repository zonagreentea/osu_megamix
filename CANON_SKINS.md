# Canon Skins (Authoritative)

Rule:
- Canon skins are the skins that must always exist in-tree.
- If a canon skin changes or is removed, it must be recorded in ERROR_ROOT.md.

Canon Skin Set:
- (list folders under `skins/` that are canon)
- (list any docs under `docs/skins/` that define the canon)

Notes:
- Skins may change presentation only; they may not change meaning.
