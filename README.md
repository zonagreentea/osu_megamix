Osu!megamix Readme — Quickstart

osu!megamix — Quickstart

Welcome! This is the fastest way to get playing.

What is osu!megamix?

osu!megamix is a rhythm game inspired by osu!, focused on tight timing, clean rules, and forward momentum. Hit notes on the beat. Finish the song. Feel good doing it.

Requirements

Keyboard (recommended)
Audio on (timing matters)
A supported mix / beatmap
Mouse is optional depending on mode.

Launch

Start the game / runtime
Load a song or mix
Press play
That’s it.

How to Play

Core Loop
Circles fall toward the hit line
When a circle reaches the line → press a key
Timing > everything
Controls (default mental model)
Two hit keys (commonly Z / X)
Use either or alternate — both are valid
You can rebind keys if needed.

Timing Rules

Hit on the beat
Early = miss
Late = miss
On time = hit (good / great / perfect)
If visuals disagree with the music, trust the music.

Difficulty & Flow

Start on Easy or Normal
Misses are okay — keep going
Momentum matters more than perfection
One mistake does not end a run.

Ending a Run

When the song ends, the run ends
The game exits cleanly
You stop because you choose to stop
“See you next time.”

First-Time Tips

Play one song all the way through
Ignore score on your first run
Let your hands learn before your brain
Relax your shoulders and breathe
Philosophy (short)

Rhythm first
Clear rules
No punishment for playing
Have fun. That’s the whole point.

Done ✅
I dropped a clean README Quickstart into the canvas — ready to ship, paste, or tweak.
If you want, I can:

Tighten it further (ultra-minimal / speedrun style)
Add a Controls table
Add a “Troubleshooting / Common misses” section
Match it exactly to your repo tone (more playful / more formal)
Just say the word.
